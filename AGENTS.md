# AGENTS.md

> **Scope:** Applies to *this* directory and all nested sub‑directories unless overridden by a deeper `AGENTS.md`.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Provide **coding conventions, architectural guidelines, and procedural rules** for both humans and automated agents working on this Python codebase. The rules ensure consistency, testability, security, and maintainability.

---

## 📚 General Principles

1. **Readability > Cleverness** – prefer clear, idiomatic Python over micro‑optimisations.
2. **Single Responsibility** – each module, class, and function should serve one clear purpose.
3. **Automation First** – CI must be able to install, test, lint, and type‑check the project without manual steps.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Style

| Tool               | Config                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Formatter**      | `black --line-length 100`                                |
| **Import sorter**  | `ruff format` (or `isort` 5.x, same profile)             |
| **Linter**         | `ruff check .` with `select = ["E","F","B","I","N","D"]` |
| **Type checker**   | `mypy --strict`                                          |
| **Python version** | ≥ 3.11                                                   |

Additional rules:

* Use **type annotations** everywhere except one‑off scripts in `/scripts`.
* Variable, function, and module names: `snake_case`; class names: `PascalCase`; constants: `UPPER_SNAKE`.
* Prefer [`pathlib.Path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to string paths.
* Avoid *relative imports* except inside tests.

## 🏗️ Recommended Project Layout

```text
project_root/
├── src/               # Production code (set PYTHONPATH accordingly)
│   └── package_name/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── core/
│       ├── services/
│       └── ...
├── tests/             # pytest tests (mirrors src layout)
├── scripts/           # one‑off maintenance scripts
├── pyproject.toml     # build & tool configs (Poetry / Hatchling)
└── README.md
```

> **Note:** Keep `src` importable only via the package; do **not** rely on implicit local imports.

---

## 🔬 Testing

* Framework: **pytest**
* Minimum coverage: **90 %** lines, **100 %** for new/modified code.
* Use **fixtures** for external resources; no real network calls in unit tests.
* Property‑based tests encouraged with *hypothesis* where valuable.

Run locally:

```bash
pytest -q
coverage xml && coverage html
```

---

## 📦 Dependency Management

* Use **Poetry** or **Hatch** (preferred) declared in `pyproject.toml`.
* Pin direct dependencies with exact versions; use range spec only for libraries.
* Do **not** commit virtual‑envs or lock files other than `poetry.lock`.

---

## 🔄 Git & Branching

* **Primary branch:** `main`
* **Automated agents:** MUST create a **new branch** for every logical change set and open a Pull Request – they **MUST NOT** push directly to `main`.
* **Branch names:** English‑only, lower‑case, words separated by hyphens. Use a clear prefix:

  * Automated agents → `agent/<short-description>`
  * Feature branches  → `feat/<short-description>`
  * Hotfix branches   → `fix/<issue-or-description>`
  * Example: `agent/update-readme-links`, `feat/api-add-user-endpoint`.
* **Human contributors:** Follow the same naming conventions when creating feature/hotfix branches.

---

## 📝 Commit Message Convention

All commits **must clearly describe the changes**. Use the extended Conventional Commits format below:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

WHAT CHANGED:
- • … (concise bullet‑list of key modifications; e.g. "refactor auth helper to async")
- • …

WHY:
- • … (reason or motivation)

BREAKING CHANGES:
- • … (if applicable)

ISSUES:
- • #123, PROJ‑456 (references)
```

* **Subject line** ≤ 72 chars, lower‑case imperative mood.
* **Body** is **mandatory** except for trivial typo/doc fixes.
* The **WHAT CHANGED** section **must** list the most important modifications in plain English so a reviewer can grasp them without opening the diff.
* If the commit introduces a **breaking change**, include a dedicated **BREAKING CHANGES** block.
* Every commit should compile, pass tests, and keep CI green.
